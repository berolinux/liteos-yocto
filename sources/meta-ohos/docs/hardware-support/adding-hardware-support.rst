Adding New Hardware Support in All Scenarios OS
###############################################

This section details the addition of new hardware to the supported set in
All Scenarios OS. It is intended as a checklist for adding new boards to OHOS build
system.

Before starting get familiar with All Scenarios OS Contribution Process.

   :depth: 2

Select All Scenarios OS Flavour
*******************************

All Scenarios OS uses a notion of kernel specific flavours:

- Linux flavour
- Zephyr flavour
- FreeRTOS flavour (experimental)

Flavours have predefined `IMAGES` and `MACHINES`.

A single board can be included in more than one flavour only when it has **well
maintained support** in targeted kernels.

Add Required meta-layers
************************

OHOS flavours configuration templates (stored in `OHOS/meta-ohos/flavours <https://git.ostc-eu.org/OSTC/OHOS/meta-ohos/-/tree/develop/flavours>`_
directory) consist of the following files:

.. list-table:: Configuration Files
   :header-rows: 1

   * - File Name
     - Description
   * - ``bblayers.conf.sample``
     - set of meta-layers for the specific flavour (it can be unified across
       multiple layers where there are no layers incompatibilities)
   * - ``conf-notes.txt``
     - text snippet to be used as part of build logs
   * - ``local.conf.sample``
     - default flavour build configuration

All Scenarios OS build system uses ***repo*** tool for cloning required meta-layers
into appropriate build directory structure (see :ref:`Setting up a repo workspace <RepoWorkspace>`).
To include a new layer, it has to be added in two places:

- `OHOS/manifest <https://git.ostc-eu.org/OSTC/OHOS/manifest>`_
- `OHOS/meta-ohos flavours <https://git.ostc-eu.org/OSTC/OHOS/meta-ohos/-/tree/develop/flavours>`_
  as part of the respective flavour ``bblayers.conf.sample``

Test Image Backward Compatibility Of Newly Added Layers
*******************************************************

New BSP layers cannot interfere / break already supported ``IMAGES`` / ``MACHINES``.

Document and Advertise the New ``MACHINE`` Support
**************************************************

Newly added ``MACHINE`` shall be documented in: :ref:`Hardware Support <RepoWorkspace>`.
Use an existing board documentation as template and populate it accordingly for
your newly added machine.

The same machine needs to also be advertised in two places:

- Flavour's ``local.conf.sample`` as a commented out ``MACHINE`` variable value
  (tweak this step accordingly for default machine change)
- Flavour's ``conf-notes.txt`` to surface the support in build logs

Create Merge Requests
*********************

Create Merge Requests to ***develop*** branch according to the Contributing Process for repositories:

- `OHOS/meta-ohos <https://git.ostc-eu.org/OSTC/OHOS/meta-ohos>`_
- `OHOS/manifest <https://git.ostc-eu.org/OSTC/OHOS/manifest>`_

After meta-ohos MR is merged, update ``meta-ohos`` revision in manifest MR.
