OpenThread
##########

OpenThread is an open-source implementation of the Thread networking protocol
based on IPv6. It is designed for low-powered devices that operate in a mesh
network based on the IEEE 802.15.4 standards.
Some of the main advantages of implementing OpenThread are:

* Simple to install and operate.
* Mandatory authentication of devices.
* All communications are encrypted.
* Self-healing mechanism with no single point of failure in a mesh network.
* Support for low-powered devices.
* Scalable up to hundreds of devices.
