Machines and Flavours
---------------------

The following GitLab job definitions are included by the central shared
pipelines in the manifest repository and constitute the set of supported
combination of ``FLAVOUR`` and ``MACHINE``.

.. warning::

    Do not include YAML files from the meta-ohos repository directly. The
    primary entry point for build and test pipelines is defined by the manifest
    repository.
